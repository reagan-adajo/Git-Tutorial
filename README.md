# BMI calculator
In this project, we are going to write a python program to calculate BMI.

Measurements:

1. Weight(kgs)

2. Height(m)

BMI = Weight/(Height * Height)

We will use the BMI to determine whether the user is Overweight, Normal, or Underweight.

This is my last edit

Thank you!

We have made changes to a new branch

#Results

BMI > 25 = "Overweight"

BMI < 18 = "Underweight"

BMI between 18 and 25 = "Normal"
